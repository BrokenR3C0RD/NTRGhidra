# NTRGhidra fidDb

NTRGhidra comes with a handy Function ID database that allows function fingerprinting and easier reversing.

# NitroSDK

At the moment, only one database is available: _nitrosdk3.0.0_ which corresponds to hashes of functions of comercial games that were compiled using NitroSDK 3.0.0. Probably, this database can also identify functions from newer versions, specially those that wouldn't have changed from one version to another.

# Supported functions/libs

This is a sumarized list of supported functions or modules in the last release of the database:

(ARM)

* crt0
* filesystem archive 
* filesystem command
* filesystem file 
* filesystem memory
* filesystem overlay
* filesystem rom

(THUMB)
